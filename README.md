Every page of my website has a flex box to copywriter myself, except the about me because I like everything centered on my description.

The “Home” page of my website starts with a header introducing the cite. The page is a layout of my picks for the first 6 main card UFC fights of 2025 inside flex-boxes. Below are other analyses of each fight from someone else online with links to their respective cites. At the bottom is a form to explain why you disagree with me, if so. Submitting it opens up default email for user.

About me page has a professional photograph of me, as well as 3 short paragraphs introducing myself and explaining what my life is like inside and out of coding. At the bottom is a button to view my resume.

My resume page has a header with name and contact info. There are sections/flex-boxes for my objective, education, skills, projects, experience, and extracurricular activities.

My Citations page declares itself. Then a flex box for image sources with mock links to the image with credited photographer/s. The next flexes contains content references, in which I again linked the analysts in the home page and their articles.
